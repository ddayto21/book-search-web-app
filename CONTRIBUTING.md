### Commit Messages

We prefer using the Conventional Commits format for commit messages. This helps in automating the release process and generating the changelog.

Format:

```
<type>(<scope>): <subject>
```

Types:

- `feat`: A new feature
- `fix`: A bug fix
- `docs`: Documentation only changes
- `style`: Changes that do not affect the meaning of the code (white-space, formatting, missing semi-colons, etc)
- `refactor`: A code change that neither fixes a bug nor adds a feature
- `perf`: A code change that improves performance
- `test`: Adding missing or correcting existing tests
- `chore`: Changes to the build process or auxiliary tools and libraries such as documentation generation

Example:

```
feat(auth): add OAuth2 login
```
